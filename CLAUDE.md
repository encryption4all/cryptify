## Agent notes (migrated from the dobby memory repo)

## Overview
`encryption4all/cryptify` is a Rocket/Rust file-upload service: a sender uploads a
file, cryptify PostGuard-seals it for a signed recipient, and emails a notification.
Backend only. `pdf-signature` is a fork sharing the same README, with a divergent
frontend and a slightly different config shape (see that repo's own notes).

## Config
Backend config lives in `conf/config.toml` (prod) and `conf/config.dev.toml` (dev).
Keys: `server_url`, `address`, `data_dir`, `email_from`, `smtp_*`, `allowed_origins`,
`pkg_url`. The backend reads `ROCKET_CONFIG=config.toml` baked into the Dockerfile,
`[global]` profile in `conf/config.toml`. Compose bind-mounts `./conf/config.toml`
to `/app/config.toml:ro`; mutating the bind-mounted file requires a container
restart to take effect.

## Release process
Release-plz automation.

## Build / test
- `cargo check`, `cargo build --release`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy --all-targets`
  all work from repo root.
- No library target: tests live in `src/**` under `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `quality` job) runs `cargo fmt --all -- --check`,
  `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test --all-targets` on
  every PR. Run all three locally before pushing; a fmt/clippy failure blocks the PR.
- **Docker build Rust version can lag behind CI's stable toolchain.** The CI
  `Rust quality` job uses `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` (always latest), but the
  Docker `Build (amd64/arm64)` jobs use the pinned `FROM rust:<ver>-slim-trixie` in
  the `Dockerfile`. These can diverge enough that a dependency's build script needs
  a newer Rust than the pinned Docker image ships (happened when `rusqlite`'s
  `bundled` feature started needing `cfg_select`, stabilized in Rust 1.94, while
  Docker was pinned to 1.93). When adding a dep, check whether it needs a newer Rust
  than the Dockerfile's pin and bump the Dockerfile if so. `rust:*-slim-trixie`
  already ships gcc, so `bundled` C compilation works without extra apt installs.
- **Tests that touch `Store` need a tokio runtime.** `Store::new()` spawns a purge
  task via `rocket::tokio::spawn`; under plain `#[test]` it panics with "no reactor
  running". Use `#[rocket::async_test]` and `async fn`, even when the body never
  awaits.

## Running the binary
- Needs a reachable PKG server (`pkg_url`) at startup or it panics on
  `/v2/sign/parameters`. For config tests, prefer a serde-roundtrip unit test over
  booting the server.
- SMTP, `data_dir`, `pkg_url` are all required.

## Request pipeline (build_rocket layering)
- Two seams in `src/main.rs`: `default_figment()` returns the bare
  `rocket::Config::figment()`; `build_rocket(figment, vk)` extracts
  `CryptifyConfig`, computes body-size limits from `config.chunk_size()`, merges
  them, then constructs `rocket::custom(...)`.
- **Do NOT extract config inside `default_figment()`.** Integration tests layer
  config on top with `default_figment().merge(...)`. Extracting too early panics
  with `MissingField`.
- Body-size headroom is `chunk_size + 1 MiB` on `bytes`, `data-form`, `file`.
  Per-request reads are still capped by `data.open((end - start).bytes())` in
  `upload_chunk`.

## Upload flow and state lifetime
- `POST /fileupload/init`: in-memory `FileState` keyed by UUID. Sender unknown at
  this point.
- `PUT /fileupload/<uuid>`: write a chunk (<= 1 MiB), advance `state.uploaded`. The
  cryptify token rolls per chunk as `SHA256(prev_token || chunk)`.
- `POST /fileupload/finalize/<uuid>`: run the postguard Unsealer over the whole
  file to extract attributes; `sender` (`pbdf.sidn-pbdf.email.email`) becomes
  known.
- **Purge timer:** `state.expirations` (a `BTreeMap` populated in `Store::create`
  at `src/store.rs:292` with `Instant::now() + self.shared.idle_ttl`) is what
  `purge_task` walks. `idle_ttl` defaults to `DEFAULT_UPLOAD_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS`
  (`60 * 60`, 1 hour); this is a resettable idle timeout, not a hard deadline from
  creation. `Store::touch` (`src/store.rs:318`) removes the old `expirations` key and
  re-inserts `Instant::now() + idle_ttl` on each chunk PUT and status check, so the
  hour counts from the last activity (see the `touch_extends_eviction_deadline` test
  at `src/store.rs:545`). `FileState.expires` (current_time + 14d) is NOT what drives
  eviction; it's a different field, never read by the purge loop. When tracing
  eviction, follow `state.expirations`.
- Purge does not delete the on-disk file. Rejecting at finalize must manually
  `tokio::fs::remove_file` and `store.remove(uuid)`.
- In-memory only, no persistence. Process restart wipes all upload sessions and
  orphans on-disk files in `data_dir/` (tracked as cryptify#116).
- Per-sender usage tracking is a `HashMap` in `StoreState.usage`, optionally backed
  by SQLite when config `usage_db = "<path>"` is set: `UsageDb` (rusqlite,
  `bundled`) is the source of truth, the map is a cache loaded on startup and
  written through on each `record_upload` (which also prunes rows outside the 14d
  rolling window). `usage_db` unset means in-memory only (old behaviour). A
  configured-but-unopenable DB panics at startup.

## Token chain must be checked on every route touching a FileState
The upload token chain (`SHA256(prev || chunk)`) must be validated on every route
that operates on an existing `FileState`, not just `PUT`. An earlier version only
checked it on `PUT`, letting anyone who guessed a live UUID finalize another user's
upload (fixed). When adding new routes, mirror the token check `upload_chunk` uses;
don't trust UUID knowledge alone as authorization.

## CORS
`allowed_origins` is a single regex string in `rocket_cors` 0.6.0.
`AllowedOrigins::some_regex` compiles via `regex::RegexSet`; standard alternation
works fine. The regex is anchored (`^...$`), so there's no subdomain/wildcard
bypass.

## Metrics
- `GET /metrics`: Prometheus text format, unauthenticated by design. Lock down at
  the firewall, not the endpoint.
- Channel label derived in priority: `X-Cryptify-Source`, then
  `Authorization: Bearer` / `X-Api-Key` (-> `api`), then `Origin` (-> `website` /
  `staging-website`), then `User-Agent` (-> `outlook` / `thunderbird`), then
  `unknown`. Sanitized to `[a-z0-9_-]`, max 32 chars.
- Storage gauges are sampled from `data_dir` on a background task (default 60s,
  `metrics_scan_interval_secs`).
- `FileState.source_channel` is populated at `upload_init` from request headers;
  populate it in any new test fixtures too.

## Integration test harness
- `build_rocket(figment, vk)` is the injection point. `#[launch] rocket()` wraps it
  and fetches vk via `minreq` for production.
- `CryptifyConfig.email_stub: bool` (default false) short-circuits `send_email`;
  set true in test figments.
- `pg_core::test::TestSetup` provides `VerifyingKey` plus an encryption policy and
  signing keys. The test policy includes `pbdf.sidn-pbdf.email.email =
  "bob@example.com"`; seal with `signing_keys[2]` (Bob) for finalize to succeed.
- pg-core's Sealer API uses rand 0.8; cryptify uses rand 0.9. Dev-deps alias
  `rand08 = { package = "rand", version = "0.8" }`; use `rand08::thread_rng()` only
  in test code calling pg-core directly.
- Integration tests live inline in `src/main.rs` under `mod integration`, not in
  `tests/` (that would require a library target).
- Each test gets a per-test temp `data_dir` under `std::env::temp_dir()` with a
  uuid suffix for parallel safety.

For handler-level tests that need `State<CryptifyConfig>` and `State<Store>`
without the full `build_rocket` injection point:

```rust
use rocket::figment::{providers::Serialized, Figment};
use rocket::local::asynchronous::Client;

let figment = Figment::from(rocket::Config::default()).merge(Serialized::defaults(
    serde_json::json!({
        "server_url": "http://localhost",
        "data_dir": data_dir.to_str().unwrap(),
        "email_from": "Test <test@example.com>",
        "smtp_url": "localhost",
        "smtp_port": 1025u16,
        "allowed_origins": ".*",
        "pkg_url": "http://localhost",
    }),
));

let rocket = rocket::custom(figment)
    .mount("/", routes![upload_init])
    .attach(AdHoc::config::<CryptifyConfig>())
    .manage(Store::new());
let client = Client::tracked(rocket).await.unwrap();
```

Gotchas: `#[rocket::async_test]` is required (Store spawns purge_task, needs a
reactor). `InitBody` is camelCase; send `mailContent` and `mailLang` (not
snake_case) or you get a 422. `email::Language` serializes uppercase (`"EN"`,
`"NL"`). This minimal harness only works for routes that don't need the verifying
key (`upload_init`, `health`, `usage`); routes needing vk need the full
`build_rocket(figment, vk)`.

## X-PostGuard header convention
Cryptify's notification emails set an `X-PostGuard` header using the `pg-core`
crate version as the value (e.g. `X-PostGuard: 0.6.1`), wired at build time via
`build.rs` reading `Cargo.lock`. This gives operational visibility into which
postguard version processed a given email, and it advances automatically as
`pg-core` is bumped, no manual updates needed. This supersedes an earlier
preference for a semantic token like `notification` (cryptify#170).

For reference, the tb-addon (Thunderbird) implementation sets
`x-postguard: 0.1.0` via `customHeaders` on `onBeforeSend`; detection of "is this a
PostGuard message" elsewhere uses the `postguard.encrypted` attachment or the
inline `-----BEGIN POSTGUARD MESSAGE-----` marker, not this header.
`X-PostGuard-Client-Version` is a separate, unrelated HTTP header sent on PKG
requests (not a MIME header on the email).

## Security: reviewed and confirmed clean, don't re-report
From the 2026-07-02 in-depth security audit (the one confirmed finding from that
audit, unauthenticated `/usage` enumeration, was fixed and merged in PR #183):
- **Path traversal on `GET /filedownload/<filename>`**: guarded by
  `is_safe_download_segment` (rejects empty, len>128, `/`, `\`, NUL, `.`, `..`).
  On-disk files are named by random UUIDv4, so the download key is an unguessable
  capability.
- **HTML injection / XSS in notification emails**: `mail_content` is
  attacker-controlled (init is unauthenticated) but rendered via Askama as
  `{{html_content}}` without `|safe`, so it's auto-HTML-escaped. The `.txt`
  template uses `escape="none"` correctly for plaintext.
- **Email header injection**: `recipient` is parsed via lettre `Mailboxes`;
  `reply_to` comes from the signed IRMA email attribute. lettre validates both.
- **Upload/finalize auth**: chunk PUT and finalize are gated by the rolling
  `cryptify_token` (`SHA256(prev||chunk)`); finalize checks it too. The status
  endpoint is gated by a constant-time `X-Recovery-Token` comparison, with
  401-vs-404 collapsed to avoid leaking session existence.
- **Secrets in git history**: none; `conf/config.toml` and `config.dev.toml` only
  ever had commented-out placeholders.
- **`/metrics` unauthenticated**: known and by design, locked down at the
  firewall.
- **`/staging/preview/<uuid>`**: 404s unless `staging_mode` is on; safe in prod.

## Test-runner quirk

`Store` tests need a tokio runtime: use `#[rocket::async_test]` on `async fn`, even when the body never awaits.
